# Scrabble Game

The objective of the Scrabble Game project is to create a digital version of the classic word game "Scrabble".Scrabble is a game in which players score points by forming standard dictionary words on the game board. This implementation will feature a layered architecture, consisting of the model layer, the view layer, and the view-model layer.


## Features

- Model Layer: This layer focuses on implementing the core game logic, including tile placement, scoring, word validation, and maintaining the game state. It will handle all the rules and calculations required for gameplay.

- View Layer: The view layer is responsible for the graphical user interface (GUI) of the game. It will provide an intuitive and visually appealing interface for players to interact with the game, including features like displaying the game board, player tiles, score tracking, and game notifications.

- View-Model Layer: The view-model layer acts as the bridge between the model and view layers. It will handle the communication and synchronization of data between the two layers, ensuring that the game state and visual representation remain consistent.
